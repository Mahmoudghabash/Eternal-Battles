# Eternal-Battles
A card game using pygame, still in the very early stages
this is me learning python and it went pretty good until it came to me that the game needs networking which I don't know anything about
however I will still make it, and when it comes to that stage I will need to start learning some networking to make it work :)
so yeah, I making a multiplayer game without any networking knowledge :) 


thing to be done:
1 - A deck building system [70% Done] (the Deck will be stored so you don't need to make a deck everytime you reopen the game, but editing decks what's missing here)
2 - A main menu [Done with the potential to Have more buttons]
3 - The ability to play cards (Of course...) [Mostly Done, the battle system what will make it Done]
4 - A battle system [not Done]
5 - After the game mechanics are done, I am gonna start working on images to make it look better, so no, it will not be rects forever (hopefully)
6 - that all that came to my mind now I will add anything I think of here 

thank you for checking my game out
